  stateText: 'You aren''t sure what you expected to find in the stall, but it certainly
    wasn''t a dead security guard! He appears to have been beaten mercilessly. Perhaps
    that accounts for the state of the bathroom?



    In any case, he is beyond help at this point. As you examined the body to see
    if he was still breathing, you found his sidearm in its holster.



    You can TAKE the GUN.

    You can ENTER the BATHROOM.'
  visitedText: 'The guard is still dead, his gun still in its holster.
