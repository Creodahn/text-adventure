    ...



    Wait... this isn''t possible! Didn''t you just escape this tunnel? What''s going
    on here?

    Looking around yourself, you see the large pile of bricks from the wall is blocking
    the way that you came. Some broken glass is covering the ground. A pile of rubble
    blocks the tunnel ahead of you.



    You can LOOK AT the BRICKS.

    You can LOOK AT the broken GLASS.

    You can LOOK AT the RUBBLE ahead of you.'
