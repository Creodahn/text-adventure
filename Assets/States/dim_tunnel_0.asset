  stateText: 'In the dark, your hand brushes something plastic and cylindrical. You
    pick it up. The cylinder widens toward one end. You feel a rectangular protrusion
    on the side. As you try to figure out what it is, the flashlight turns on, blinding
    you. It seems that you flicked the switch without realizing it.



    You can LOOK AROUND to see where you are.'
