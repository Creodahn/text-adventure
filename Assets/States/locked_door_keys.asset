  stateText: 'Around a bend in the tunnel, you come to a door. You try the handle.
    It is locked. Fortunately, you found some keys that you can try in the lock. They
    seem to work. The door is now unlocked.



    You can OPEN the DOOR.

    You can RETURN to the previous section of tunnel.'
  visitedText: 'The door still stands as it did previously. Remembering that you relocked
    it as you left, you take out the keys and unlock it again.



    You can OPEN the DOOR.

    You can RETURN to the previous section of tunnel.'
