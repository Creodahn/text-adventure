    of dust. Coughing, you try to clear the dust cloud by waving you arms in front
    of your face.



    After several minutes, the dust is clear enough for you to see a new passage has
    opened in the previously impenetrable pile.



    You can ENTER the OPENING in the bricks.

    You can RETURN to the main part of the tunnel.'
