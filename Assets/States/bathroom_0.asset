  stateText: 'Inside the bathroom, it looks as though there was a fight. The mirrors
    are cracked and broken, several of the sinks have large chunks taken out of them,
    and water seeps from under the door of more than one stall.



    All of the stall doors are locked shut except for one. It yawns open, as if beckoning
    you to look inside.



    You can ENTER the STALL.

    You can RETURN to the tunnel.'
  visitedText: 'The bathroom remains in the same state of disarray that you found
    it, with perhaps slightly more foul-smelling water on the floor.



    You can ENTER the open STALL.

    You can RETURN to the tunnel.'
