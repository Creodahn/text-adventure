  stateText: 'After an indeterminate amount of time, you stop cowering. Cowering in
    fear has not changed your situation much. The tunnel still branches to the right
    and left.



    You notice that you have been hearing a new sound for the past few minutes. You
    are unsure of what it is, or where it is coming from.



    You can GO LEFT to try squeezing through the collapsed walls.

    You can GO RIGHT to try sneaking through the sparking wires.

    You can LISTEN to the SOUND.'
