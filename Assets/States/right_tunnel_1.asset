  stateText: 'As you run toward the right branch of the tunnel, the beast howls and
    charges you. It slams into the backs of your legs, sending you flying directly
    into the hanging wires. Stunned by an electrical shock, you don''t stand a chance
    as the beast descends upon you.



    The sights, sounds, and smells that follow are best left undescribed.



    CONGRATULATIONS? You''re... well, no longer in the tunnel, anyway.



    Type RESTART to play again.'
