  stateText: 'As you crawl through the opening in the pile of bricks, chunks of mortar
    fall on you. At first, you are too distracted by picking your way through the
    small space to notice, but as you continue and more and more detritus falls on
    you, it is impossible to ignore. Where before you had plenty of space, you are
    now beginning to feel crushed by the weight of the fallen bricks. You crawl through
    as fast as you can, and manage to get to the other side of the pile of bricks
    just as the whole thing collapses. You are now trapped on this side of the pile.



    You can FUMBLE AROUND in the dark to see if you can find anything.'
