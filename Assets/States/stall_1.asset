  stateText: 'Now that you have taken the security guard''s gun, there is nothing
    more you can do here. You offer a silent promise to the dead guard that you will
    let someone know his body is here.



    You can ENTER the BATHROOM.'
  visitedText: 'The guard is still dead, so he doesn''t seem to notice your repeated
    visits. You feel that you''ve been spending too much time staring at his corpse.
    Perhaps it''s time to go somewhere else?



    You can ENTER the BATHROOM.'
