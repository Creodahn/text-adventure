  stateText: 'As you enter the alcove, you nearly knock over a potted plant that you
    could not see in the dark. Serendipitously, this causes you to put out your hand
    to steady yourself against the wall, and you hit the light switch. The tunnel
    floods with light, and you are nearly blinded in the sudden brightness. After
    taking a few moments to adjust, you look around the alcove.



    On a small table, you see some keys.



    You can TAKE the KEYS.

    You can RETURN to the main part of the tunnel.'
  visitedText: 'The keys still sit on the table where they were before.



    You can TAKE the KEYs.

    You can RETURN to the main part of the tunnel.'
