As you enter the room, you are set upon by a vast number of living shadows. You have a moment of hope as you remember the gun that you found. You are able to pull out the gun and pull the trigger.


The click of the hammer falling on an empty chamber consumes your entire world.


You can try to WITHSTAND the attack.
