As you enter the alcove, you nearly knock over a potted plant that you could not see in the dark. Serendipitously, this causes you to put out your hand to steady yourself against the wall, and you hit the light switch. The tunnel floods with light, and you are nearly blinded in the sudden brightness. After taking a few moments to adjust, you look around the alcove.


On a small table, you see some keys.


You can TAKE the KEYS.
You can RETURN to the main part of the tunnel.
