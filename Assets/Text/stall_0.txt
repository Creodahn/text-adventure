You aren't sure what you expected to find in the stall, but it certainly wasn't a dead security guard! He appears to have been beaten mercilessly. Perhaps that accounts for the state of the bathroom?


In any case, he is beyond help at this point. As you examined the body to see if he was still breathing, you found his sidearm in its holster.


You can TAKE the GUN.
You can RETURN to the bathroom.
