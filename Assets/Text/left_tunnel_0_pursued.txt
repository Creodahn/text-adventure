You dash past the creature, narrowly avoiding a great swipe that takes a new chunk out of the walls. You manage to squeeze into the crack just before the shadow beast can grab you. You can hear it scrabbling at the opening, trying to pursue you. As you reach the end of the narrow space, the beast grabs the cuff of your pants. You pull as hard as you can to get away. For a long moment, it seems that you are stuck fast, but then your pants cuff gives way with a loud rip and you stumble out into the open tunnel beyond the collapsed walls. As you do, you collide with a large timber that had been keeping the passage open. The impact of your fall knocks it to the ground, causing the space between the walls to collapse completely. You shiver, hoping that it will be the last you see of the beast.


You pick yourself up and dust yourself off, surveying your surroundings.


You can FOLLOW the TUNNEL.
