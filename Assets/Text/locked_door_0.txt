Around a bend in the tunnel, you come to a door. It looks rather imposing, with several large signs saying things like 'DO NOT ENTER' in various languages. Some signs also have helpful graphics of stick figures being variously maimed and otherwise abused.


You walk up to the door in the tunnel. Trying the handle, you discover that it is locked, and you don't have the key. You try forcing the door, but it is far too sturdy for the likes of you to force it open.


You can RETURN to the previous section of tunnel.
