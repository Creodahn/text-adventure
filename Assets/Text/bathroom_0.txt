Inside the bathroom, it looks as though there was a fight. The mirrors are cracked and broken, several of the sinks have large chunks taken out of them, and water seeps from under the door of more than one stall.


All of the stall doors are locked shut except for one. It yawns open, as if beckoning you to look inside.


You can ENTER the STALL.
You can LEAVE the bathroom.
