You awaken in a dark place. As you slowly regain consciousness, you realize that everything around you looks very familiar.

...


Wait... this isn't possible! Didn't you just escape this tunnel? What's going on here?
Looking around yourself, you see the large pile of bricks from the wall is blocking the way that you came. Some broken glass is covering the ground. A pile of rubble blocks the tunnel ahead of you.


You can LOOK AT the BRICKS.
You can LOOK AT the broken GLASS.
You can LOOK AT the RUBBLE ahead of you.
