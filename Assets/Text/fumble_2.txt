You find your way to a wall and begin to crawl along it, hoping it will lead you somewhere with some light. Suddenly, the wall ends and you realize that is was just an outcropping of debris that had fallen into the tunnel.


You can FUMBLE AROUND in the dark some more to see if you can find anything.
