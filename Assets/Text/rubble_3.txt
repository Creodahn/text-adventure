You frown as you approach the rubble strewn section of tunnel. Something seems wrong. After a moment, you notice that the PIPE which previously stuck from the RUBBLE is nowhere in sight. In its place is a small crack that is constantly leaking water. There doesn't seem to be anything to do here.


You can RETURN to the main part of the tunnel.
