You squeeze through the crack between the collapsed walls. As you go, you hear something scrabbling at the opening where you entered. You quicken your pace as much as possible. The scratching noise seems to be getting closer and closer. You have the distinct feeling that you are not alone. As you reach the end of the narrow space, something grabs the cuff of your pants. You pull as hard as you can to get away. For a long moment, it seems that you are stuck fast, but then your pants cuff gives way with a loud rip and you stumble out into the open tunnel beyond the collapsed walls. As you do, you collide with a large timber that had been keeping the passage open. The impact of your fall knocks it to the ground, causing the space between the walls to collapse completely.


You pick yourself up and dust yourself off, surveying your surroundings.


You can FOLLOW the TUNNEL.
