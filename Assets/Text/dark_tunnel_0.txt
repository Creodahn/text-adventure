As you crawl through the opening in the pile of bricks, chunks of mortar fall on you. At first, you are too distracted by picking your way through the small space to notice, but as you continue and more and more detritus falls on you, it is impossible to ignore. Where before you had plenty of space, you are now beginning to feel crushed by the weight of the fallen bricks. You crawl through as fast as you can, and manage to get to the other side of the pile of bricks just as the whole thing collapses. You are now trapped on this side of the pile.


You can FUMBLE AROUND in the dark to see if you can find anything.
