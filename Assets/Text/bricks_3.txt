Pulling on the BRICKS causes the whole pile to collapse in a large cloud of dust. Coughing, you try to clear the dust cloud by waving you arms in front of your face.


After several minutes, the dust is clear enough for you to see a new passage has opened in the previously impenetrable pile.


You can ENTER the OPENING in the bricks.
You can RETURN to the main part of the tunnel.
