You awaken in a dark place. As you slowly regain consciousness, you recall
that you were walking through a tunnel when an earthquake began.
You must find a way out as quickly as possible!
Looking around yourself, you see a large pile of bricks from the wall
is blocking the way that you came. Some broken glass from what appears
to be a lighting fixture is covering the ground.
A pile of rubble is blocking the tunnel ahead of you.
You can LOOK AT the BRICKS.
You can LOOK AT the broken GLASS.
You can LOOK AT the RUBBLE ahead of you.
