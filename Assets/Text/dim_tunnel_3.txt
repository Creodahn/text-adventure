You listen intently to the sound. As you do so, you pan your flashlight across the tunnel to see if you can find its source. Gradually, you begin to tell it is coming from the lefthand branch of the tunnel. As you look, a shadow oozes from the crack between the collapsed walls. At first it does not appear threatening, but it grows larger as you watch. The shadow takes on hard, pointed edges, and you realize that the sound is its inhuman growling.


The shadow begins creeping closer, now appearing as some great multi-legged beast. You look around yourself, trying to find some way out.


You can try to GO LEFT and get around the creature through the crack it came from.
You can GO RIGHT and try to escape it through the sparking wires.
